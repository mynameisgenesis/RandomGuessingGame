# RandomGuessingGame

This is just a random guessing game creating in JavaScript. I just prompt() to collect the users guess then compare it to the random number
that the computer thought of. After comparison the computer will let the user know if they guessed correctly and ask if they want to try
again. It will restart the game it the user click ok.
